The Process


  I start making the backend by making the product, updating the user and making upload resourses. Also I personalized my backend by making some validation.

  I jumped to the front end and making products and cart resourser and tried to make my website easy and smooth to use.

  The last day I worked on styling using CSS and Bootstrap.
