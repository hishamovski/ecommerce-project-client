### Technologies Used:
```

    JavaScript
    HTML/CSS
    Bootstrap
    MongoDB & Mongoose
    Node.js
    Express.js
    AWS/S3
    JSX
```

### The Process:

```
  The planning process involved wire framing for the front-end and drawing an ER Diagram on the back-end. The back end (Express.js) was set up and tested by curl scripts first. Then work began on the front-end: carving out React components and user flows.

  The development process start by developping the backEnd by creating product, cart, upload documents and updating user document. Then, I jumped to the front end and start by making the crud methods for products and cart components. The last day of the project I focused on styling using CSS and React Bootstrap.

### Unresolved Issues:

```
Because I had only four days making ecommerce project. the future iteration that I can add is: orders overview for the purchaser and sales overview for the seller. User can check a summary of all prodcuts purchase, Also the seller can check a summary of all sales he made and displaying a chart that represents total income each weeek.
